                    <p>
                      Born in 1996, I grew up in a lovely little town called Shawnigan Lake and still miss the beautiful nature there till this day. After graduating highschool I did a year of engineering at Camosun College but decided I wasn't ready to commit on a degree. Instead, I worked as a Lifeguard at Crystal Pool in Victoria, BC for several years and considered becoming a paramedic but decided against it after responding to several extreme injuries which started to wear me down.

                    <h5 class="card-title">Volunteering & Travel</h5>
                    <p>
                      It was in 2017 that I decided to travel to Nairobi, Kenya and volunteer as both a music & science teacher after comtemplating how much good my limited money could do here vs in a poorer country (utilitarian logic at the time). It was a very intense experience as I was working in Kibera, the largest slum in africa that resides on the side of Nairobi, but between a close friend I made there and the kids I taught it was a very fulfilling experience. After this four month period of volunteering i decided to tour some historical sites as I was already across the Atlantic and made my way to Jerusalem in Israel, Istanbul in Turkey, and London in England. The most rewarding part of all these travels were the people I met everyday staying in hostels and the amazing historical architecture I saw such as Valens aquaduct, the Holy Sepulchre, the Hagia Sophia, Big Ben, and more.

                    <h5 class="card-title">Current Day</h5>
                    <P>
                      Today, I am enrolled at Seneca College doing a Bachelors in Software Development and looking for a 2021 summer internship. I'm eagerly looking forward to taking the three years of study I've done and applying it to real business projects. The biggest time consumer of my days currently is my capstone project, Brix, which is due to be released in its 1.0 form this May, 2021.
